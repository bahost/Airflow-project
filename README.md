# Project description

This Python GitHub project focuses on creating a robust and scalable data pipeline that efficiently extracts and processes data from multiple sources, including API calls and AWS S3, ultimately orchestrating the entire pipeline using Apache Airflow. 

The project is designed to showcase a best-practice approach to building end-to-end data pipelines, combining various data sources, performing complex transformations, and leveraging Apache Airflow for automated and reliable workflow management.
